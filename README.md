# Rolodex
My final project for C++, in which I had to design a roldex in C++.
This project was designed as my final for my C++ class I took. After running, a command window will provide you with a few options and ask the user to enter a command. The rolodex is prefilled with some dummy data, and you may add/remove entries. In addition, you can flip to the next option, and view all entries. This data is not persisted, as it reads in just the dummy data (for now).
